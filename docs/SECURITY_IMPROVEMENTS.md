# Security Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document tracks all security enhancements implemented in the LegacyGuard application, focusing on the transition from client-side key storage to a secure server-side key management system with Clerk authentication.

## Timeline of Security Improvements

### Phase 1: Initial Security Assessment
**Date:** August 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Critical:** Encryption keys stored in browser localStorage (vulnerable to XSS attacks)
2. **Critical:** No key rotation mechanism
3. **High:** No audit logging for key access
4. **High:** No recovery mechanism for lost keys
5. **Medium:** Keys persisted indefinitely in browser storage

### Phase 2: Database Schema Security Hardening
**Date:** August 25, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

#### Implemented Changes:

##### 2.1 Authentication System Migration
- **Migration Files:** 
  - `20250823092701_setup_legacyguard_schema.sql`
  - `20250823094915_fix_storage_policies_for_clerk.sql`
  - `20250823095937_fix_documents_rls_for_clerk.sql`
  
- **Changes Made:**
  - Migrated from Supabase Auth (UUID) to Clerk Auth (TEXT user IDs)
  - Created `app.current_external_id()` function to extract Clerk user ID from JWT
  - Updated all RLS policies to use Clerk authentication
  - Removed dependencies on `auth.users` table

##### 2.2 Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation
- **Tables Protected:**
  - `documents` - Users can only access their own documents
  - `document_bundles` - Bundle access restricted to owner
  - `wills` - Will documents protected per user
  - `user_encryption_keys` - Key access strictly limited to owner
  - `key_rotation_history` - Audit logs viewable only by owner
  - `user_key_recovery` - Recovery data protected per user

- **Policy Pattern:**
  ```sql
  CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON table_name
    FOR SELECT USING (app.current_external_id() = user_id);
  ```

### Phase 3: Server-Side Key Management System
**Date:** August 25, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Migration:** `20250825120000_create_key_management_system.sql`

#### 3.1 Database Tables Created

##### `user_encryption_keys`
- Stores encrypted private keys (never plain text)
- Public keys stored for encryption operations
- Includes salt and nonce for key derivation
- Tracks key version and rotation count
- Security features:
  - Compromise detection flag
  - Failed access attempt tracking
  - Temporary account locking
  - Last access timestamp

##### `key_rotation_history`
- Complete audit trail of all key rotations
- Tracks rotation reason and method
- Links old and new key versions
- Timestamp and user attribution

##### `user_key_recovery`
- Multiple recovery methods supported:
  - Guardian-based recovery (Shamir's Secret Sharing)
  - Security questions
  - Backup phrases
  - One-time recovery codes
- Recovery attempt limiting
- Backup contact information

##### `key_access_logs`
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Tracks all key operations (retrieve, rotate, recover, generate, delete)
- Records IP address, user agent, device fingerprint
- Success/failure tracking with reasons

#### 3.2 Security Functions Implemented

```sql
-- Safe key retrieval (returns only public key)
get_user_active_key(p_user_id TEXT)

-- Key rotation with audit trail
rotate_user_key(...)

-- Rotation necessity checker
check_key_rotation_needed(p_user_id TEXT)

-- Failed access handler with lockout
handle_failed_key_access(p_user_id TEXT, p_reason TEXT)
```

### Phase 4: API Security Layer
**Date:** August 25, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

#### 4.1 Key Generation Endpoint (`/api/keys/generate`)
**File:** `app/api/keys/generate/route.ts`

**Security Features:**
- Clerk authentication required
- Rate limiting (5 requests per minute)
- Password strength validation (zxcvbn score ≥ 3)
- Secure key derivation (PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations)
- NaCl box keypair generation
- Private key encryption before storage
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Error handling without information leakage

**Process Flow:**
1. Validate authentication
2. Check rate limits
3. Validate password strength
4. Generate salt and derive encryption key
5. Generate NaCl keypair
6. Encrypt private key with derived key
7. Store encrypted key in database
8. Log operation in audit trail
9. Return public key only

#### 4.2 Key Retrieval Endpoint (`/api/keys/retrieve`)
**File:** `app/api/keys/retrieve/route.ts`

**Security Features:**
- Clerk authentication required
- Rate limiting (10 requests per minute)
- Password verification required
- Failed attempt tracking
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (15 minutes)
- Audit logging for all attempts
- Secure key decryption in memory only

**Process Flow:**
1. Validate authentication
2. Check rate limits
3. Verify account not locked
4. Retrieve encrypted key from database
5. Derive decryption key from password
6. Decrypt private key in memory
7. Log successful access
8. Return decrypted key (HTTPS only)

### Phase 5: TypeScript Key Management Service
**Date:** August 25, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**File:** `lib/encryption/keyManagement.ts`

#### Service Architecture:

```typescript
class KeyManagementService {
  // Key Generation
  - generateKeyPair(): Secure NaCl keypair generation
  - deriveKeyFromPassword(): PBKDF2 key derivation
  
  // Encryption/Decryption
  - encryptPrivateKey(): Secure private key encryption
  - decryptPrivateKey(): Secure private key decryption
  
  // Storage Operations
  - storeUserKeys(): Database storage with encryption
  - retrieveUserKeys(): Secure key retrieval
  
  // Key Rotation
  - rotateKeys(): Complete key rotation with re-encryption
  
  // Security
  - validatePasswordStrength(): zxcvbn integration
  - markKeyCompromised(): Compromise handling
}
```

#### Security Features:
- No direct localStorage access

#### Issues Fixed:
1. **Permission Errors:** Removed unauthorized COMMENT statements
2. **Function Creation Order:** Fixed dependency order in migrations
3. **RLS Policy Conflicts:** Handled view dependencies during column type changes
4. **Type Mismatches:** Aligned all user_id columns to TEXT for Clerk
5. **View Recreation:** Properly dropped and recreated dependent views

#### Affected Migrations:
- `20250825070000_create_wills_system.sql` - Fixed sequence grant, updated to TEXT user_id
- `20250825090000_security_hardening.sql` - Added view handling, function updates
- `20250825120000_create_key_management_system.sql` - Updated RLS policies for Clerk

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security (authentication, authorization, encryption)
- RLS policies at database level
- API rate limiting
- Application-level validation

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- Users can only access their own data
- No delete permissions on encryption keys (only deactivation)
- Audit logs are append-only

### 3. Secure by Default
- All new tables have RLS enabled
- Encryption required for all sensitive data
- Strong password requirements enforced

### 4. Audit and Compliance
- Comprehensive logging of all security events
- Immutable audit trail
- Failed attempt tracking

### 5. Key Management Best Practices
- Keys never stored in plain text
- Secure key derivation (PBKDF2)
- Regular key rotation capability
- Multiple recovery mechanisms
- Temporary lockouts for brute force protection
