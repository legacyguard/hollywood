# 🔍 Quality Control Checklist

## 📋 Session Quality Gates

### Before Starting Any Implementation
- [ ] Previous session tasks are 100% complete
- [ ] Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] Current codebase compiles without errors
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date

### During Implementation (Per File/Component)
- [ ] TypeScript types are complete and strict
- [ ] ESLint rules pass without warnings
- [ ] Prettier formatting applied
- [ ] Component renders without errors
- [ ] Props/interfaces are properly documented
- [ ] Error handling is implemented
- [ ] Loading states are handled

### After Implementation (Per Feature)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration with existing code verified
- [ ] UI/UX consistency maintained
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness preserved
- [ ] Accessibility guidelines followed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Memory leaks checked (for complex components)

### Before Session End
- [ ] All code changes committed with descriptive messages
- [ ] TRANSFORMATION_PROGRESS.md updated
- [ ] Next session prompt prepared
- [ ] Any blockers or issues documented

## 🧪 Testing Protocols

### Level 1: Technical Validation
```bash
# TypeScript compilation
npm run build

# Linting
npm run lint

# Unit tests
npm test

# Component rendering test
npm run test:components
```

### Level 2: Integration Testing
```bash
# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y
```

### Level 3: User Experience Testing
- [ ] Manual testing of user flows
- [ ] Sofia personality responses appropriate
- [ ] Animations smooth and purposeful
- [ ] Loading states intuitive
- [ ] Error messages helpful
- [ ] Mobile experience polished

## 📊 Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript
- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types (use proper interfaces)
- Complete JSDoc for public APIs
- Error handling with proper types

### React Components
- Functional components with hooks
- Proper dependency arrays
- Memoization where appropriate
- Clean component hierarchy

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS classes
- Consistent design system usage
- Responsive design patterns
- Dark mode compatibility

### State Management
- TanStack Query for server state
- Local state with useState/useReducer
- Context only for global app state
- No prop drilling beyond 2 levels

## 🚨 Red Flags (Auto-Fail Conditions)

### Code Red Flags
- [ ] Compilation errors
- [ ] ESLint errors (warnings OK in development)
- [ ] Failed tests
- [ ] Console errors in browser
- [ ] Unhandled promise rejections
- [ ] Memory leaks in DevTools

### UX Red Flags  
- [ ] Components don't render on mobile
- [ ] Accessibility violations (critical)
- [ ] Performance regression > 20%
- [ ] Breaking existing user flows
- [ ] Sofia responses feel robotic/inappropriate

### Security Red Flags
- [ ] API keys exposed in client code
- [ ] User data logged in console
- [ ] Insecure data transmission
- [ ] Missing input validation
- [ ] XSS vulnerabilities
