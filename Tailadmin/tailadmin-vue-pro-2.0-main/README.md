## Installation

### Prerequisites

To get started with TailAdmin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:

- Node.js 18.x or later (recommended to use Node.js 20.x or later)
- Recommended IDE Setup: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

#### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

### Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

3. Production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```
